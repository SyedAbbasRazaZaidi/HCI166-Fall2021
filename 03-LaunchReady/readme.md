   ### Background
      
Our final Idea was Proctor Based Examination & Learning System we got that idea after merging two ideas within a single platform A platform where all the entities the Admin Teacher and our first priority student can access all the resources can schedule learning according to there feasibility with ease of access and efficiently we achieved this idea after a a group brainstorming session storyboard and scnario reloplays in the narrowing down part we though that merging all the platform and visualizing them under one roof of a web application would be a great and healthy initiative we followed a long process of design thinking and disscussing interacting with the limitied case studies and online serveys we created a functional wireframe by using "Power Mockup" which is a extension to powerpoint but before that there has to be a rough sketch a low-fi prototype theat were the paper prototypes we made paper prototypes cleared our mind for the wireframes the options we have to give the design, How to keep it simple and efficient how make the design **user Centerd** HCI concepts helped us a lot in this process the concepts  were in our mind sub-conciously above in the repo you can visit our wireframes adnd see how much we have implemented those concepts we tried our best to cover all the aspects in the amount of time provided :smiley: .
