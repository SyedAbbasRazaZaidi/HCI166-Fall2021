### Scenario 2
#### Teacher Young: Ahmed Mirza

A teacher from Sujawal School Of Sciences whose name is Ahmed Mirza has met with an accident in which he got fracture in his leg. Doctor`s have advised him to take bed rest for about 5 to 6 months. Now the issue is that he is the only bread earner in his family and because of that he cannot quit his job teaching at school. So he was watching TV at home and suddenly he saw an AD of the company that has developed a system called E-Classrooms with Class Scheduler and online sessions. He got an idea that he can use this system to teach students from home easily without any issue.
