## Idea2: Management System to Manage Courses & Assignments
### Scenario 3
#### Admin 2 (Junior): Akbar Ali
He is at junior position of administration his job title is course administration. He want to make sure that every student are in correct subject of their class and instructor scheduling must have to know which class and which subject do their have but in hybrid mode he can't make the time table and contact the teachers and because of no resources he worked by hands.
We suggest him to create a management software of courses that he can use anytime and anywhere to manage all the student courses, add, drop, schedule, faculty schedule , syllabus checking etc. He might be Happy to hear this but his school and students is not much rich to buy this plan so we can sponsor the devices and complete setup to this school.
