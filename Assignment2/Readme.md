What is HCI ?

- Human-computer interaction (HCI) is an area of research and practice that emerged in the early 1980s, initially as a specialty area in computer science embracing cognitive science and human factors engineering.
- HCI is basically a study of how a user uses technologies to accomplish different task.

## History of HCI …

- Computer had one task, performed sequentially
- No “interaction” between  operator and computer after starting the run
- Punch cards, tapes for input
- Serial operations

## Computing from 1945 - 2020

### ENIAC
   - Ballistics calculations
   - Physical switches (before microprocessor)
   - Paper tape            
   - Simple arithmetic & fixed calculations (before programs)                             
   - 3 seconds to multiply
### SketchPad
   - Sketchpad - 1963 PhD thesis at MIT
   - Hierarchy - pictures & subpictures
   - Master picture with instances ( i.e. , OOP)
   - Constraints                                                                                                   
   - Icons
   - Copying
   - Light pen input device
   - Recursive operations
### Kay’s Dynabook, IBM PC
   - System is more powerful if - it’s easier to use
   - Small, powerful machines - dedicated to individual                                                       
   - Importance of networks - and time-sharing
   - Time names “The Computer” Man of the Year, 1982
### Apple Macintosh
   - Aggressive pricing - $2500
   - Not trailblazer, smart copier
   - Good interface guidelines
   - 3rd party applications
   - High quality graphics and laser printer

**The list goes a long way to Alexa and to major enhancements in the field of HCI coming forward ….**


At last we discussed about a video from ted by speaker:
        
        “ Sean Follmer designs shape-changing and deformable interfaces that take advantage of our natural dexterity and spatial abilities.”
